      "reason": "This is a high-conviction setup driven by massive institutional insider accumulation. Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. has purchased over $300 million worth of stock in the last month, including a $69 million buy on Jan 28 and continued buying through Feb 6. Technically, the stock just triggered a bullish MACD crossover and price has reclaimed the 20 EMA and VWAP, signaling a trend reversal. With a 100% win rate for the insider buying strategy historically, the catalyst is immediate and powerful.",

      "reason": "CEO Ryan Cohen purchased $21.3 million worth of shares on Jan 21, providing a strong floor of confidence. The stock maintains a high short interest of 16.1%, creating a classic squeeze setup alongside bullish technicals (MACD bullish, RSI > 60). The ML model predicts a win (49.8%), and recent Reddit diligence highlights institutional ownership exceeding the float. The risk/reward is asymmetric due to the volatility and cult-like following combined with insider backing.",

Despite recent consolidation, the ML model gives it a 50.5% win probability. The combination of extremely high short interest and bullish technical structure suggests an explosive move could occur if volume spikes. Volatility is high, but the technical floor is established.",
