      "reason": "GameStop presents a high-conviction setup driven by substantial insider buying, specifically Ryan Cohen's recent $21M purchase. With a high short interest of 16.1% and a 'Predicted: WIN' signal from the ML model, the stock is primed for a squeeze. Technicals confirm strength with an ADX of 52.5 indicating a very strong trend, and the RSI at 62 allows room for further upside. The alignment of insider conviction and retail momentum makes this the top asymmetric opportunity.",
