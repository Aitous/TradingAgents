The setup is primed for a squeeze with 16.1% short interest and significant recent insider buying, notably a $21 million purchase by CEO Ryan Cohen. Options sentiment is strongly bullish with a Put/Call ratio of 0.248, suggesting traders are positioning for upside. Technically, the stock is in an uptrend above its 200 SMA, and the convergence of retail momentum and insider conviction offers an asymmetric risk/reward profile.",
