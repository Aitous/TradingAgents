      "reason": "WRB exhibits a powerful confluence of massive insider accumulation and bullish technicals. Insiders, specifically Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, have purchased over $308 million in shares recently, signaling immense confidence. Technically, the stock is in an uptrend above the 50 SMA with a fresh MACD bullish crossover. The combination of institutional conviction and technical momentum makes this a prime candidate for immediate upside.",

      "confidence": 9,
      "reason": "AVR presents a high-conviction setup driven by a $28.75 million insider purchase by a 10% beneficial owner. The stock is in a 'STRONG UPTREND' technically, trading well above its 50 SMA, and recently triggered a bullish stochastic crossover. While volatility is high, the insider activity suggests a strong fundamental catalyst may be unfolding. Analyst sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish at 87.5%.",

      "confidence": 8,
      "reason": "MANE is showing explosive momentum with a recent 18.51% 5-day gain, backed by over $66 million in insider purchases. The trend strength is exceptional with an ADX of 93.9, though the RSI of 82.2 suggests it is overbought; however, in strong momentum phases, stocks can remain overbought for extended periods. The convergence of price action and heavy insider buying validates the upward trajectory.",

      "reason": "KMB offers a defensive growth setup with unusual bullish options activity (Call/Put volume ratio favoring calls) and recent insider buying. Technically, it has triggered a MACD bullish crossover and is trading above its 20 and 50 SMAs. While the RSI is high, the flow of capital into calls suggests anticipation of further upside, possibly seeking safety in consumer staples.",
