      "reason": "This is a high-conviction trade driven by a massive cluster of insider buying totaling over $43 million, including a $30.7M purchase by Column Group and significant buys by Directors. Technically, the stock is showing a bullish MACD crossover and a strengthening ADX trend of 62.0, indicating powerful momentum. With the price above the 20, 50, and 200 SMAs, the alignment of institutional accumulation and technical breakout is perfect. The volatility is high (ATR 13%), offering rapid upside potential in the short term.",

      "reason": "Institutional insider Mitsui Sumitomo has aggressively accumulated shares, with 9 transactions totaling over $315 million in recent weeks, providing a massive floor for the stock price. The technicals confirm this bullish sentiment with a fresh MACD crossover and the price holding above all major moving averages. RSI is healthy at 61.1, leaving room for further upside before becoming overbought. The confluence of relentless insider support and a confirmed uptrend makes this a low-risk, high-probability setup.",

      "reason": "A massive $28.75 million purchase by L1 Capital represents a significant vote of confidence relative to the company's $550M market cap. The stock is in a strong uptrend, currently trading above its 20, 50, and 200 SMAs. While the MACD is slightly cooling, the OBV is rising, confirming accumulation volume alongside price.

Technically, the stock is in a strong uptrend above all key moving averages, with a bullish stochastic setup.

The stock has just triggered a bullish MACD crossover and is trading above its 20, 50, and 200 SMAs.

The stock is in a strong uptrend generally (above 50/200 SMA), though it has dipped recently, potentially setting up a 'buy the news' event if earnings surprise.

Despite a recent death cross, the MACD has just turned bullish, and the 5-day change is a strong +9.01%.
