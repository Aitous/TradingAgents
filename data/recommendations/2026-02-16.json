      "reason": "ADM presents a perfect convergence of bullish signals with an extraordinarily low Put/Call ratio of 0.007 on high volume, indicating massive bullish positioning. Insider confidence is confirmed by a recent Director purchase of $486k. Technically, the stock is in a strong uptrend, trading above both its 50 and 200 SMAs with rising OBV. The combination of institutional accumulation and technical strength suggests immediate upside.",

      "reason": "Institutional insider Mitsui Sumitomo has aggressively accumulated over $223M in shares, including a $68M purchase on Feb 11. This level of insider conviction is a leading indicator of undervaluation or upcoming catalysts. The stock is technically healthy, holding an uptrend above its 50 SMA.
