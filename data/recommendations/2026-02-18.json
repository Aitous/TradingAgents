      "reason": "This is a high-conviction trade driven by relentless insider accumulation from Mitsui Sumitomo, totaling over $225 million in recent purchases, including a purchase on Feb 13, 2026. The stock is in a confirmed uptrend with the price above the 20 and 50 SMAs and rising On-Balance Volume (OBV). With a bullish RSI of 56.3 and a bullish options Open Interest put/call ratio, the technicals align perfectly with the insider vote of confidence. The risk/reward is highly asymmetric given the institutional backing.",
