The options flow is extremely bullish with a Put/Call ratio of 0.235, suggesting institutional positioning for continued upside. Technicals show a bullish stochastic crossover and price reclaiming the 20 EMA, validating the momentum. The unusually high volatility (ATR 5.5%) favors a rapid >5% move within the 7-day window.",

      "reason": "Sonos is backed by high-conviction insider buying, with Coliseum Capital purchasing over $21 million worth of shares in February 2026. Coupled with a high short interest of 14.8%, this insider accumulation creates a strong floor and potential squeeze catalyst. Although the stock is in a downtrend, the aggressive accumulation suggests a nearing bottom or reversal. The high volatility allows for a quick percentage gain once sentiment shifts.",
