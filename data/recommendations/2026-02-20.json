      "reason": "This candidate aligns with the 'undiscovered_dd' strategy, which has shown a historical 100% win rate. The stock is reacting to a strong narrative regarding a Trump Executive Order on deep sea mining, validated by intraday momentum of +4.4%. Unusual bullish options flow (P/C ratio 0.355) and 10.5% short interest create a setup for a rapid repricing event. The convergence of a macro catalyst and retail discovery creates high asymmetric upside.",
